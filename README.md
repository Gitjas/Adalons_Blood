# Adalon's Blood

A short quest extention mod for BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET!

Adalon's Blood Modification enables the player to ask Adalon for somewhat of her blood to end the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District without having to kill her. This is mainly aimed at good aligned characters who want to finish the quest in a good way: to discover and eradicate the clients of the skinner and cleanse the armor in a temple. 
Nevertheless, evil characters with CHAR of 18 or higher may also attempt to convince Adalon to sacrifice some of her blood. There is a 25% chance of success for them in deceiving the silver dragon.

+ New answer option with Fael inserted which allows a good character to accept the silver dragon blood-quest without having to play evil
+ Answer option with Adalon inserted which allows the PC to ask for some of her blood
+ Fight with the Aboleth in Usth Natha (after returning of Adalon's eggs)
+ Added option to hand over the human skin armor to a temple.
