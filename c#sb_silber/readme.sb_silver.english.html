<h1><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h1>
<div class="section">

NOTE: If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting a new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 
<br />
Make sure the game is not running while installing the mod.<br />
When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.<br />

<h2> <a name="eegames" id="quest">Notes to modding EE games</a></h2>
The EE games are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. 
<h2> <a name="windows" id="quest">Windows</a></h2>
Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory (which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). On successful extraction, there should be an c#sb_silber folder and a setup-c#sb_silber.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#sb_silber.exe and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
Run setup-c#sb_silber.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
<h2> <a name="osx" id="quest">macOS</a></h2>
Extract the mod archive, then copy the contents of the folder into your game folder (which contains the CHITIN.KEY file). If properly extracted, you should have a "c#sb_silber" folder, setup-c#sb_silber, and setup-c#sb_silber.command in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#sb_silber.command and follow the instructions on screen.<br />
Run setup-c#sb_silber.command in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.<br />
<h2> <a name="linux" id="quest">Linux</a></h2>
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run WeInstall c#sb_silber in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. <br />

</div>

<h1><a name="compat" id="compat">Compatibility with other mods and Install Order</a></h1>
<div class="section">
Adalon's Blood was implemented with WeiDU with highest priority to compatibility with other mods.<br />
As a quest (extention) mod, it should be installed before NPC and tweak mods.<br />

</div>

<h1><a name="content" id="content">Description</a></h1>
<div class="section">
<h2> <a name="generalcontent" id="generalcontent">General Info</a></h2>
Adalon's Blood Modification is for Baldur's Gate II (BG2, BGT, BGII:EE, EET). It enables the player to ask Adalon for somewhat of her blood to end the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District without having to kill her. This is mainly aimed at good aligned characters who want to finish the quest in a good way: to discover and eradicate the clients of the skinner and cleanse the armor in a temple. 
Nevertheless, evil characters with CHAR of 18 or higher may also attempt to convince Adalon to sacrifice some of her blood. There is a 25% chance of success for them in deceiving the silver dragon.<br />
You do not have to start a new game to play the mod. However, the modification has to be installed *before* visiting Ust Natha the first time. <br />
More content can be seen if the mod is installed before the first meeting with the 'skinner' Fael in the Umar Hills. <br />
If the Mod was installed before the first entering of the Drow city, there is (beside fighting it) an additional possibility to defeat the Aboleth.<br />


<h2> <a name="content" id="content">Content</a></h2>
      <ul> 
		<li>New answer option with Fael inserted which allows a good character to accept the silver dragon blood-quest without having to play evil
		<li>Answer option with Adalon inserted which allows the PC to ask for some of her blood</li>
		<li>Fight with the Aboleth in Usth Natha (after returning of Adalon's eggs)</li>
		<li>Added option to hand over the human skin armor to a temple.</li>
      </ul> <br />


<h2> <a name="spoiler" id="spoiler">Walkthrough / Spoilers</a></h2>	
In BGII, a good-aligned PC gets involved into the quest up to the point where the unfinished skin-armor can be found and the ingredient "silver dragon blood" is requested. Up to this point no evil action is needed (on the contrary, the good aligned PC tries to stop the murders.)<br />
This mod gives the possibility to continue the quest without killing for the blood, taking into consideration that Fael disappears for good the moment the PC confronts him, thus giving a possibility to get to the customers of that armor. (It also gives the possibility to give the armor to a temple.)<br />

The mod just gives one way to "end" this quest for good aligned characters in a way it makes any sense, for those who want it. This was done in the less intrusive way possible, so to say. There is no new confrontation with any client other than what is already in the game, as this was not the scope of this mod. It's just an easy and small addition so the quest can be closed by all PCs. <br />
