        			Adalon's Blood 
			A Baldurs Gate II - Modification
                     by Gandalf the White; coded by jastey
					
					Version 14


Adalon's Blood Modification enables the player to ask Adalon for somewhat of her blood to end the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District without having to kill her. This is mainly aimed at good aligned characters who want to finish the quest in a good way: to discover and eradicate the clients of the skinner and cleanse the armor in a temple. 
Nevertheless, evil characters with CHAR of 18 or higher may also attempt to convince Adalon to sacrifice some of her blood. There is a 25% chance of success for them in deceiving the silver dragon.

You do not have to start a new game to play the mod. However, the modification has to be installed *before* the PC has brought back Adalon's eggs to her. 
More content can be seen if the mod is installed before the first meeting with the 'skinner' Fael in the Umar Hills. 
If the Mod was installed before the first entering of the Drow city, there is (beside fighting it) an additional possibility to defeat the Aboleth.


CONTENT

+ New answer option with Fael inserted which allows a good character to accept the silver dragon blood-quest without having to play evil
+ Answer option with Adalon inserted which allows the PC to ask for some of her blood
+ Fight with the Aboleth in Usth Natha (after returning of Adalon's eggs)
+ Added option to hand over the human skin armor to a temple.


INSTALLATION
 
General (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
Make sure you back up your dialog.tlk file (and dialogf.tlk, if it exists), just to be sure. Extract the contents of the mod archive to your game's main directory. 

Also, if you have previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, uninstall all previously installed components and delete the mod folder and executables. 

Note: When installing or uninstalling, do not close the DOS window by clicking on the X button! Instead, press the Enter key when instructed to do so.

To finally install the mod, follow the instructions:

Windows
On successful extraction, there should be a "c#sb_silber" folder and a "setup-c#sb_silber.exe" file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#sb_silber.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
Run setup-c#sb_silber.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.

Mac OS X
Make sure you have the Mac OS X version of the mod (named "OSX-AdalonsBlood-vx.zip"). If properly extracted, you should have a "c#sb_silber" folder, a "setup-c#sb_silber" file, and setup-c#sb_silber.command in your game's main directory folder. To install, simply double-click setup-c#sb_silber.command and follow the instructions on screen.

Linux
Make sure you have the Linux version of the mod (named "lin-AdalonsBlood-vx.zip"). Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from WeiDU.org and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you have already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there is no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you have extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file names. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
Run WeInstall setup-c#sb_silber in your game folder to install the mod. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing.


If you have installation problems or encounter any bugs, please contact me via the above e-mail or post your bug report at Gibberlings Three ( http://forums.gibberlings3.net/ ), or for German version at Kerzenburgforum (http://kerzenburg.baldurs-gate.eu) in the BG2 Modification forum:

COMPATIBILITY

Adalon's Blood Modification was programmed with WeiDU (other used tools see below), and, hence, should be compatible with other WeiDU-Mods. 


I am interested in your experience concerning compatibility so please let me know other mods with which you have played this mod, also (especially) if you did not encounter any problems.
